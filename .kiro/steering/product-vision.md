# Product Vision

## Overview
<!-- Brief description of what the product is and who it's for -->
A book recommendation web app that delights the user.

## Problem Statement
<!-- What problem does this solve? Why does it need to exist? -->
Most book recommendation engines rely on "Collaborative Filtering" (People who bought X also bought Y). This often recommends books that are too similar or fails to capture why a reader actually liked a book (e.g., they liked the "sparse, clinical prose," not the sci-fi setting).

## Target Users
<!-- Who are the primary users? What are their needs? -->
The Inarticulate Searcher — a reader who knows how they want to feel but lacks the literary vocabulary to describe it

## Key Goals
<!-- What are the main objectives? What does success look like? -->
The Librarian is a Vibe-Based Discovery Engine. It deconstructs a book into its "DNA" to help the Inarticulate Searcher. The system prioritizes "Pivoting" (freshness) over "Cloning" (repetition). Success comes when the user discovers a book they wouldn't have found on their own.
