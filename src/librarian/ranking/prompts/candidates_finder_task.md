Avoid books with these dealbreakers: {dealbreaker_text}

Focus on books recommended as similar to "{seed_title}". For each book, you MUST explain in detail:
1. Why you ranked it in that position (1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc.)
2. Which specific user preferences it matches well
3. Any concerns or weaknesses compared to user preferences, as it must be clear why the book is ranked lower than higher-ranked books.

Limit your explanation to 1000 characters maximum.
